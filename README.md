# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

https://videl90.github.io/daily-planner/

1. Created my HTML layout. 
2. Used bootstrap elements to build it and make it responsive
3. Changed some classes.
4. Added the jquery links, and the moment.js API, to make the time elements work. The first thing I added was the current day and hour.
5. Created the function to change the input color according to the past and present hours. 
6. Then I created the local storage function, so that my tasks would be saved in the console
7. Finally created some variables for each task, so that my tasks would be saved, even though I refreshed the page.
